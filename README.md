Using Computer Vision
Creating a cartoon effect using computer vision and OpenCV involves transforming an input image into a stylized representation reminiscent of a cartoon. This is achieved by applying a series of image processing techniques such as edge detection, color quantization, and image abstraction to enhance contours and simplify colors. OpenCV, along with various algorithms, enables the extraction of cartoon-like features from the original image, resulting in an artistic and visually appealing output resembling hand-drawn cartoons.
